# Isochrone-Generator
Isochrone Python Script (Ran through ArcMAP)

The projectâ€™s goal is to use ArcGIS and Python to generate isochrone maps based on distance traveled via a car or truck from a specific location. The Isochrone map creates colored intervals around two points showing how far you could travel by roadway from these points. In our instance, every shading of color represents a minute of travel.

The reasoning for creating this script is to help allow local communities and governments understand the best locations for building fire departments and EMS response buildings, and overall this can be a useful urban development tool.
